This program is a simple crossword solver, which takes a a 3x3 or 4x4 matrix, with some letters prefilled, and determines a possible solution 
based on the most common English dictionary words. Designed and coded by Michael Austin, with the exception of the words34 dictionary, which 
was borrowed from the DOGCAT project in Russell and Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd Edition.

Project development plan:
V1: Working crossword solver, which iterates through rows, and checks columns. (You are here)
V2: Improve search speed by implementing a cross-hatching method, which fills in row->column->row->column
V3: Further improve search speed by searching through most likely words first, regardless of position.
V4: Expand dictionary size and length by building maxheap dictionary from publicly available documents
V5: Using large dataset of existing crosswords, develop ML system to classify crossword clues using K-Nearest Neighbours approach.
